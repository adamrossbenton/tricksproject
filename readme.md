TRICKS: THE MEETING

Do you really like Magic: the Gathering, but you're too poor to buy five thousand cards every week?
That's ok, me too!

TRICKS: THE MEETING is a MtG pack-opening simulator, designed to almost perfectly recreate the experience of being the only one in your friend group that's into Magic. It utilizes a comprehensive card database API to generate random 15-card "packs" using the API found right here: https://docs.magicthegathering.io/

FEATURES:

* "Get Pack" button, generates 15 MtG cards at random

(Currently jumps to a random page of API, from 1 to 612, then pulls 15 cards at random from one of the 100 cards on that page)

* Add newly acquired cards to your library to save them for later--maybe show them off to your friends!

    "Check out my awesome new Black Lotus card, I got it for free online!"

    "Yeah but it's not real."

    "WELL THEN NEITHER IS OUR FRIENDSHIP!"

* Breathtakingly underwhelming animations

COMING SOON:

* Hover over each card to get details (mana cost, abilities, power/toughness, etc.) 

* Build a deck from the cards in your library that you've acquired. You can't do much with it, but at least you've got it, which is kinda cool right?

* Ask us to build a deck for you! Tell us what you want in a deck and we'll pull cards at random that fit your specifications

Must choose:

    Color type(s)

Optional choices:

    Creature type(s)

    Ability(ies)

We can't guarantee it will be a good deck, but again, at least you've got a deck!
