TRICKS: THE MEETING

Do you really like Magic: the Gathering, but you're too poor to buy five thousand cards every week?
That's ok, me too!

That's why I've created Tricks: the Meeting!

This is a MtG pack-opening simulator that utilizes a comprehensive card database API to generate random 15-card "packs" using the API found right here: https://docs.magicthegathering.io/

FEATURES:

"Get Pack" button, generates 15 MtG cards at random

COMING SOON:

Hover over each card to get details (mana cost, abilities, power/toughness, etc.) 

Add newly acquired cards to your library to save them for later--maybe show them off to your friends!

    "Check out my awesome new Black Lotus card, I got it for free online!"

    "Yeah but it's not real."

    "WELL THEN NEITHER IS OUR FRIENDSHIP!"

Build a deck from the cards in your library that you've acquired. You can't do much with it, but at least you've got it, which is kinda cool right?

Ask us to build a deck for you! Tell us what you want in a deck and we'll pull cards at random that fit your specifications

Must choose:

    Color type(s)

Optional choices:

    Creature type(s)

    Ability(ies)

We can't guarantee it will be a good deck, but again, at least you've got a deck!

Breathtakingly underwhelming animations
